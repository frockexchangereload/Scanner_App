In order to run your application, type:

  $ cd media_scanner
  $ flutter run

Your application code is in media_scanner\lib\main.dart.

The configured version of Java detected may conflict with the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version in your new Flutter app.

To keep the default AGP version 8.7.3, download a compatible Java version
(Java 17 <= compatible Java version < Java 24). Configure this Java version globally for Flutter by running:

  flutter config --jdk-dir=<JDK_DIRECTORY>

Alternatively, to continue using your current Java version, update the AGP
version in the following file(s) to a compatible version (minimum compatible AGP version: 7.0):
    C:\Users\zoeml\OneDrive\Dokumente\GitHub\Scanner_App\media_scanner\android/build.gradle

For details on compatible Java and AGP versions, see
